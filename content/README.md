# Content directory

in this directory you can find the content of the website. The content is written in markdown and is rendered by the website using the `@nuxt/content` module.

## Structure

The markdown files (or the **content**) are stored in a subdirectory of this directory called `content`.  
`@nuxt/content` will automatically parse the markdown files and make them available to the website.  
Nuxt will ignore all files outside of the `content` subdirectory.
